# BlogNodeReactMicro

This is a microservice application built in node to exemplify and practice a few topics as database sincronization, microservices, the ins and outs of an event bus (there is none on this project, it's done manually).

This project is no "golden bullet" it just serves it's purpose which is stated above.
